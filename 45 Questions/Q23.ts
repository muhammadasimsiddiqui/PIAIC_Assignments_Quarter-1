/*

    Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test
    and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

    let car = 'subaru';
console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
console.log(car == 'subaru')

• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.*/
let car: string = 'subaru';

// Test 1: Is the car equal to 'subaru'? Expecting True.
console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.");
console.log(car == 'subaru');

// Test 2: Is the car equal to 'honda'? Expecting False.
console.log("Is car == 'honda'? I predict False.");
console.log(car == 'honda');

let age: number = 18;

// Test 3: Is the age greater than 16? Expecting True.
console.log("Is age > 16? I predict True.");

// Test 4: Is the age less than 18? Expecting False.
console.log("Is age < 18? I predict False.");
console.log(age < 18);

let isRaining: boolean = true;

// Test 5: Is it raining? Expecting True.
console.log("Is it raining? I predict True.");

// Test 7: Is the fruit not equal to 'banana'? Expecting True.
console.log("Is fruit not equal to 'banana'? I predict True.");

// Test 8: Is the fruit equal to 'orange'? Expecting False.
console.log("Is fruit equal to 'orange'? I predict False.");

let temperature: number = 25;

// Test 9: Is the temperature greater than or equal to 20? Expecting True.
console.log("Is temperature >= 20? I predict True.");
console.log(temperature >= 20);

// Test 10: Is the temperature less than 0? Expecting False.
console.log("Is temperature < 25? I predict False.");
